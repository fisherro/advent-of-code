;;; Use equal? for numbers in Racket
;;; eqv? is "lightly" not recommended for numbers
;;; eqv? or eq? might be faster for numbers (but not as portable)
;;; Reports are that immutable hash sets are about twice
;;; the speed of mutable hash sets.
;;; Vector might be faster...and gen:set means we could make a flat-set
